    <p>Suppose that you’ve just acquired some hard-fought knowledge or skill. Maybe you’ve made tweaks to a particularly cringeworthy area of your codebase, or finally figured out how to hook up a profiler to the system that you use to run unit tests. Anyhow, you’re done and ready to move on. Right?</p>

<p>/shrug</p>

<p>Chances are if you had to fight hard to get this far, most other people turned around a while ago. And if that’s the case, you’ll look <em>really</em> good if you whack a few easy to spot nails with your shiny new hammer that no one else has any idea how to use.</p>

<p>Practically, this could mean a few things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you just figured out a swamp of your codebase, clean up the unit tests for it (if they exist and are nasty) or write some new ones (if they don’t).</li>
  <li>If you had to learn how to do some performance profiling to speed up your code path, try profiling some other really important code paths in your project. There’s a good chance that if you had to try really hard to write performant code, some dolt messed it up elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<p>It may not be following the white rabbit for days, but a few hours? Almost certainly.</p>
