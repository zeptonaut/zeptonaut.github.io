When Erin and I remodeled our condo from a loft into a two bedroom, we tore out the modern stainless steel railings that didn't match our new more traditional aesthetic. We also had our painter paint the treads the same color as our trim, replaced the stair skirt with one that matched our new baseboards, and hired someone to refinish the treads to match the cherry floors in the rest of the house.

All of this transformed our stairs from looking like this:

To looking like this:

However, we never replaced the railing. But after watching a few family members nervously butt scoot down the stairs, we decided it was time to fix this.

I wussed out of doing it myself and instead hired Macomb Stairs & Millwork to add the banister. Within a month, they were able to fit us in and it took them about two hours and a coffee break to install the banister. Consider me humbled.

The new banister looks like this:

Erin and I are thrilled with how it came out. Unfortunately, Macomb Stair doesn't paint or stain banisters and we want to stain the handrail to match the floor but paint the newels white to match our trim. This would require two different contractors and would likely be close to as expensive as the banister itself. Because of this, I'm going to tackle the project myself.
