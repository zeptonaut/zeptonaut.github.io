    <p>I’ve been reading <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em> by Stephen R. Covey over the past few days and have loved it.</p>

<p>I’m probably a little over-enthusiastic about these types of self-help books. I read <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> by Dale Carnegie and talked about it obnoxiously to my friends, but found as I tried to apply its lessons that I need to basically reread the book continuously to remember all of its many lessons. That’s the biggest reason I like <em>7 Habits</em>: my memory’s terrible, and this way I don’t have to remember as much.</p>

<p>The second habit in the book is <em>“Begin with the end in mind”</em>. Essentially, Covey suggests that you begin all important projects by clearly defining <em>in writing</em> what success looks like. Then, as you work on the project, you should frequently review the success criteria and make sure that you’re on track.</p>

<p>Given that life is essentially one big project, he suggests having such criteria for your life. <em>When you die, how do you want your life to have been lived? What are some principles you should live by in order to live such a life?</em></p>

<p>He encourages readers to actually write these things down as a sort of personal constitution, review that consitution regularly, and curate it over time.</p>

<p>Here’s what my first attempt looks like (with some points unabashedly borrowed from Rolfe Kerr’s personal creed in the book):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Succeed at home first.</li>
  <li>Seek and merit divine help.</li>
  <li>Never compromise with honesty.</li>
  <li>Seek to earn the trust of yourself and others.</li>
  <li>Know and meet your obligations.</li>
  <li>Listen twice as much as you speak.</li>
  <li>Defend those who are absent.</li>
  <li>Care for what belongs to you. Care for what belongs to others as if it were your own.</li>
  <li>Be stubbornly positive.</li>
  <li>Develop one new proficiency each year.</li>
  <li>Focus on one task at a time.</li>
  <li>Start with small wins to build momentum.</li>
  <li>Hustle while you wait.</li>
  <li>Ask for help when necessary. Don’t shy away when it’s offered.</li>
  <li>Be generous with your time and money. Don’t squander either.</li>
  <li>Keep self-praise to yourself.</li>
  <li>Be the first to criticize yourself and the last to criticize others.</li>
</ul>
