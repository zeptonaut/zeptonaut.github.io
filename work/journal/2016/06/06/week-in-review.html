    <p>Last week was a mixed bag in terms of productivity.</p>

<p>It was a four day week, so one work day was nixed from the start. Tuesday through Thursday, I tried to spend a big chunk of my time working on <a href="https://github.com/catapult-project/catapult/issues/2285">the migration of trace viewer to Polymer 1.0</a>. I did this with the idea that, with so many high-priority tasks on my plate, it would be great to get a time-sensitive one knocked out so that I could focus on the others.</p>

<p>The highlight of this effort was the submission of <a href="https://codereview.chromium.org/2023283002/">my patch refactoring the ugly analysis tab view</a> in trace viewer. The end result confirmed my suspicion that there was a much more succinct way to write such a tabbed view using Polymer correctly. The end result: a working analysis tab view in 549 fewer lines of code.</p>

<p>Overall though, this push to quickly finish the Polymer migration didn’t pay off. The other tasks turned out to be more time-sensitive than I expected, which meant that people were constantly interrupting my work on the Polymer migration to remind me about other tasks. The migration also took more time than I expected, which led to me having the same number of tasks by Friday but with slightly more irritated coworkers because I seemed to be ignoring the task that <em>they</em> cared about.</p>

<p>I think that there are a few things that I could have done to better mitigate the effects of having too much on my plate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When there are high-priority tasks pending, I should be better about communicating <em>what</em> I’m working on along with <em>why</em> I’m working on that particular task. If I can’t provide rationale, then maybe I shouldn’t be working on it.</li>
  <li>I should have been more rigorous with applying my 50m work / 10m break modified Pomodoro schedule to my work. Instead, there were was a lot of time when I was sorta working on one thing, sorta working on another, which resulted in two tasks with slow progress instead of one with lots of progress.</li>
  <li>I just need to spend more time working. Earlier in the year, I reduced my working time to 25 work chunks per week and gradually increased it to 30 so that I could ensure that my brain was adequately trained to work for 30 chunks in a 40 hour work week. This worked well for a few weeks but fell by the wayside afterwards. The weeks when I was using this strategy were some of my happiest and most productive weeks of the year: I need to get back in this rhythm.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thankfully, by Friday, I gave up my hope of getting the Polymer migration finished this week and refocused my attention on fixing <a href="https://github.com/catapult-project/catapult/issues/2341"><code class="highlighter-rouge">catapult#2341</code></a>, which was preventing us from writing meaningful Telemetry power tests using the BattOr.  After lots of digging and some help from Oystein, I was able to figure out what needed to be fixed and Oystein has a <a href="https://codereview.chromium.org/2040663002/">patch out for review now</a> that fixes the issue.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a strong finish to a mediocre week, but I’m optimistic that I can apply the lessons from this week to ensure that I’m effective next week.</p>
