[Atom.io 1.0](https://atom.io/) was announced this week, so I decided to install it and play around. It promises to be a cross-platform editor based on web technologies: it uses Chromium to do its rendering. Supposedly you can write plugins in Javascript using HTML/CSS, which sure as heck *sounds* awesome.

I can't say much more, though. The first step in pretty much every "create your first Atom package" tutorial is to use a package called `package-generator` to generate the skeleton of your package. Unfortunately, `package-generator` currently has [a crippling bug](https://github.com/atom/package-generator/issues/27) that completely prevents it from working. Even more discouraging is the fact that the bug's been filed for five days without any visible progress.

Not impressed so far, Atom.
